   - [![Open Movie Genre Classification in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Aman-pr/Indo-Machine-learning-/blob/main/Movie_ticket/Movie_gener.ipynb)
   - [![Open Customer Segmentation in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Aman-pr/Indo-Machine-learning-/blob/main/k_means_retail-store/k_means_retail_store.ipynb)
   - [![Open Customer Segmentation in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)]([https://colab.research.google.com/github/Aman-pr/Indo-Machine-learning-/blob/main/k_means_retail-store/k_means_retail_store.ipynb](https://github.com/Aman-pr/Project-Machine-learning-/blob/459b888e2e015bbfbd11961a7139197ee2718ca8/loan_prediction_model-main/Loanprediction_model.ipynb))

2. **Upload Datasets**:
   ```python
   # In Colab notebook cells:
   from google.colab import files
   uploaded = files.upload()  # Select relevant dataset file

# Genre Classification
jupyter notebook "Movie_ticket/Movie_gener.ipynb"

# Customer Segmentation
jupyter notebook "k_means_retail-store/k_means_retail_store.ipynb"

# Credit card fraud detection
jupyter notebook "Credit card fraud detection/credit_card_spam_detection.ipynb"
